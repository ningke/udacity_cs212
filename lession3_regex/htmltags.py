# Write a function, findtags(text), that takes a string of text
# as input and returns a list of all the html start tags in the 
# text. It may be helpful to use regular expressions to solve
# this problem.

My favorite website in the world is probably

Okay, so you passed the first test case. <let's see> how you 
handle this one. Did you know that 2 < 3 should return True? 
So should 3 > 2. But 2 > 3 is always False.

It's not common, but we can put a LOT of whitespace into 
our HTML tags. For example, we can make something bold by
doing <         b           > this <   /b    >, Though I 
don't know why you would ever want to.
